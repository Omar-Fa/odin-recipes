        This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
        made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more
        traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my
        mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and
        Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green
        salad and crusty garlic bread.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>Meat: </span>This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground
            meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Onion: </span>A diced onion is cooked until translucent with
            the ground meat.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Canned tomatoes </span>You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a
            can of crushed tomatoes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Fresh herbs: </span>For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of
            parsley and crush one clove of garlic.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Sugar: </span>A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity
            from the tomatoes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Spices and seasonings: </span>This homemade lasagna is
            seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.

          <li>
            <span>Noodles: </span>Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This
            recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready
            variety to save time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Cheese: </span>The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese
            and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Eggs: </span>Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus,
            they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer
            together).
