        <h3>How to Make Hawaiian Pizza</h3>
        <p>
          Making homemade lasagna much easier than it looks. You'll find the
          full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what
          you can expect:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) with a rack in the
            lower position. Oil a large rimmed baking sheet with olive oil.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add bacon and
            cook, flipping occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, 5 to 7
            minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour out pan drippings without wiping pan clean, and return skillet
            to heat. Add pineapple, cook until lightly browned and caramelized,
            3 minutes per side. Remove from pan. Chop bacon and cut pineapple
            rings into 3/4-inch pieces.
          </li>

          <li>
            On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to a 12-inch circle and
            place on the oiled baking sheet. Prick dough with a fork several
            times to reduce air bubbles. Spread pizza sauce evenly over dough,
            leaving a 1 1/2-inch border around edges. Sprinkle with cheese, red
            onion, Canadian bacon, chopped pineapple, and chopped bacon.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbly, toppings
            are lightly charred, and crust is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.
            Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
          </li>
        </ol>
